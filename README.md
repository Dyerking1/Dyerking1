- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm a very loyal and simpathic individual with alot of empathy and understanding as well as intuition almost so as I can feel what others feel around me. I will try to help you out any way I can, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and trust them from the get go because that's how I would like to be treated but if you break that trust it's almost impossible to get it back and you never really do once it's broken. I'm a firm believer in that nothing is impossible because nothing is possible its where we keep everything and the word itself means Im Possible.
